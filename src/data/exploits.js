      'SQL Injection happens when user input is directly concatenated into a database query. The database cannot distinguish between trusted query text and untrusted user data.',
    cause:
      'Failing to use parameterized queries, dynamically building SQL strings from user input, and giving applications excessive database permissions.',
    impact:
      'Data theft, data tampering, authentication bypass, full control over the database, regulatory fines, and loss of customer trust.',

    description:
      'When known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) are not patched, attackers can reliably exploit them using automated tools and public exploit kits.',
